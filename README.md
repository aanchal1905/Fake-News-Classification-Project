# Fake-News-Classification-Project

This is a ML problem where the task is to classify Fake News in an article. Jupyter notebook consists of various stages needed for identifying fake news such as data preprocessing, model experimentation, and evaluation of results.
The datasets consist of news.csv file. It consists of a label column for the Fake News Classification part. First the data is pre-processed, then visualized graphically and then finally evaluated by calculating accuracy of different models.
The Project includes evaluating results of various models and getting the result from the best model by checking the accuracy. 
The accuracy came out to be 92% via Logistic Regression Model.
